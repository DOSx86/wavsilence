/------\
| GOAL |
\------/

The goal of the program is to take a large WAV file with gaps of
silence and create smaller WAV files, containing the data between the
gaps.  The original use was to split up the chapters of large audio
book files.

/---------\
| INSTALL |
\---------/

Unpack the archive:

  % tar xzf wavsilence-0.X.tar.gz

Get into the directory it created:

  % cd wavsilence-0.X

Make the binaries:

  % make

That's it.  Copy the binaries where you want them.

| USAGE |
\-------/

The usage information, as displayed by 'wavsilence -h':

| wavsilence v0.40 - Dan Smith (dsmith@danplanet.com)
| Usage: wavsilence <options>
| Options:
|   -g <gap>       Minimum gap (in seconds) to be considered silence
|   -t <threshold> Volume (in % of Max) to be considered silence
|   -v             Verbose mode (specify multiple times to increase verbosity)
|   -I             Print input WAV information
|   -e <cmd>       Execute <cmd> when each piece is finished, with the filename
|                  as the last argument
|   -r             Remove the WAV file after <cmd> (only valid with -e)
|   -p             Display progress and statistics during operation
|   -i <file>      Read from <file> instead of stdin
|   -n <name>      Name output files <name>N
|   -l <file>      Log summary information in <file>
|   -b <num>       Buffer input by <num> samples (1 is default; try 16)
|   -P <cmd>       Pipe output of each segment to <cmd>
|   -m <seconds>   Minimum track length (in seconds)
|   -M <minutes>   Minimum track length (in minutes)
|   -s             Skip silence (remove the silence between pieces)
|   -c <num>       Counter-start. With this option you can set the initial
|                  value of the file-number-counter.
|   -h             Display this message
| Operation:
|   WAV file is read via stdin, split at points of silence into files
|   named "piece-N.wav" (unless user specified)
 
An example invocation is:

  % ./wavsilence -g 2 -t 4 -b 64 -l log.txt -p -i bigfile.wav

This will search for gaps of >=2s where the volume is <=4% of max.  64
samples will be read at a time (to increase performance).  Progress
will be displayed during execution and a summary will be left in the
'log.txt' file when finished.

Minimum track length can be specified in minutes, seconds, or both.
For example, the following command will not split tracks shorter than
2 minutes and 31 seconds:

  % ./wavsilence -i input.wav -M 2 -m 31

Normally the splitted tracks start with the silence-gap. If you don't like
this behaviour, then use the "-s"-option which skips the silence between
the tracks.

With the option "-c <num>" you can specify the counter-start. With this option
you can set the initial value of the file-number-counter, which defaults to 0.
For example if the first piece should start with number 5 then use '-c 5'.

| PERFORMANCE |
\-------------/

Increasing the sample buffer can *really* increase the throughput of
the program.  On a dual 933MHz P3 with 256MB RAM and an ATA100 IDE
disk, a sample buffer of 64 provides optimal performance (~6MB/s).
I'd like to hear about performance others are getting.

Enabling the progress display (the -p option) may reduce performance
if you have a fast system.

When piping output to a command (the -P option), the throughput is
limited to the speed at which the command you're running can take
data.  If you have the space, it would be faster to let the program
create the pieces in separate files (the default behavior) and then
use the "-e" option to exec a program on each file when it's done.
